<p style="color:white"> Knighthood is a collaborated game I made with one of my classmates, Brian Ressler. We assigned each other our roles. I was primarily the Artist as well as the designer of the game. While Brian Ressler was the Producer and the Progammer. We decided to make our game primarily pixel based. The creation of the character is the fact that it is a knight with red hair to symbolize my favorite color and the purple shoulder pads are based off Brian's favorite color. The walking animation for the character came from the well known character Mario from the Super Mario Bros. Games, with less of a skip to his step. The other assets such as the hearts, door and slime are all going to be apart of the game. The game that Brian and I decided when making this game was to make it a down-up platform game and the goal is to reach the door while jumping onto platforms as well as passing enemy slimes. There is planned to be more assets, such as different colored slimes as well as possible attac animations for the character. This is a in-progress project so we hope to add much more.
